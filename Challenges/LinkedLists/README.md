# Linked Lists

## Summary

This project is a exercise in the implementation of the Linked List data structure.
Linked Lists are a linear data type, and can be used in a similar way as Arrays.
Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists allow for more dynamic uses such as adding, inserting, and deleting.
Also unlike Arrays, random access is not possible with Linked Lists. All elements must be accessed
sequentially, making implementation a case-by-case decision.

## Implementation

This project is implemented with multiple classes. One class represents a Linked List object,
another class represents a Node object. Both classes have properties, and the Linked List class
contains several methods for manipulating nodes within the list.

## Usage

Linked lists are best implemented when data-set size is variable and insertion/deletion operation are frequently used.
Linked list are best avoided when sorting and when random access are common required operations.
