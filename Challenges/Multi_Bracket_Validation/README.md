# Multi Bracket Validation

This challenge is an exercise in manipulating linear data structures.
Bracket validation is implemented using a Stack to contain all unmatched bracket characters.

## Challenge

Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing 
whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()

Square Brackets : []

Curly Brackets : {}
