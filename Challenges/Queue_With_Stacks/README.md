# Queue With Two Stacks

This challenge is a exercise in manipulating linear data structures.
Both "FIFO" (first-in-first-out) and "LIFO" (last-in-first-out) structures are used to impliment
a scalable data collection.

## Challenge

Implement the following methods for the Queue class:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.

dequeue() which extracts a value from the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.

You have access to 2 Stack instances with push and pop methods.
