# Array

## What is an Array?

An array is a collection of same-typed elements.
Each eleement in an array is accessed using it's index number.
Arrays have a length property.
Index numbers start at zero.
The last index of an array is it's length minus 1.

## What is it used for? Why?

Arrays are used to declare, store, and access a collection of data.
This form is used because it is more efficient to deal with the data as a set
than it is to deal with them as individual elements.

## Visual of what it looks like.

An integer array with 5 elements is commonly represented like this:


```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

A String array with three elements would be represented like this:
```
["Sarah", "James", "Harry"]
```
