# Array

## What is an Array?

> An array is a collection of same-typed elements.
An array's length property represents the number of elements contained in the array.
Each element in an array is accessed using it's index number.
Index numbers range from zero through the length of the array minus 1.

## What is it used for? Why?

Arrays are used to declare, store, and access a collection of data.
This form is used because it is more efficient to deal with the data as a set
than it is to deal with them as individual elements.

## Visual of what it looks like.

An integer array with 5 elements is commonly represented like this:


```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

A String array with three elements would be represented like this:
```
["Sarah", "James", "Harry"]
```
