# Hashtables

## What is a Hashtable?

> A hashtable is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type,
a structure that can map keys to values. A hashtable uses a hash function to compute an index of an array of buckets or slots, to which the desired value can be stored or retrieved.


## What is it used for? Why?

In many situations, a hashtable can be more effiecient than a graph or tree. A well dimensioned hashtable
can have an average lookup speed independent of the number of elements in the table.
