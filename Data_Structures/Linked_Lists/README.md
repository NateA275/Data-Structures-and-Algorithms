# Linked Lists

## What is a Linked List?

A linked list is a linear collecion of of data elements.
Each element contains it's own data as well as a referance to the next element in the sequence.


## What is it used for? Why?

Linked lists are best utilized when add/delete operations are performed frequently and data size is variable.
These operations are much less resource intensive with a linked list than they are with an array.
